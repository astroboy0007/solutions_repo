# Measuring Earth's Gravitational Acceleration with a Pendulum

## Motivation  

The acceleration $g = 9.8 \, \mathrm{m/s^2}$ due to gravity is a fundamental constant that influences a wide range of physical phenomena. Measuring $g \, \mathrm{}$ accurately is crucial for understanding gravitational interactions, designing structures, and conducting experiments in various fields. One classic method for determining $g \, \mathrm{}$  is through the oscillations of a simple pendulum, where the period of oscillation depends on the local gravitational field.
