# Measuring Earth's Gravitational Acceleration with a Pendulum

## Motivation  

The acceleration *g* due to gravity is a fundamental constant that influences a wide range of physical phenomena. Measuring *g* accurately is crucial for understanding gravitational interactions, designing structures, and conducting experiments in various fields. One classic method for determining *g* is through the oscillations of a simple pendulum, where the period of oscillation depends on the local gravitational field.
