# Problem 1

# Interference Patterns on a water surface

## Motivation:
Interference occurs when waves from different sources overlap, creating new patterns. On a water surface, this can be easily observed when ripples from different points meet, forming distinctive interference patterns. These patterns can show us how waves combine in different ways, either reinforcing each other or canceling out.

Studying these patterns helps us understand wave behavior in a simple, visual way. It also allows us to explore important concepts, like the relationship between wave phase and the effects of multiple sources. This task offers a hands-on approach to learning about wave interactions and their real-world applications, making it an interesting and engaging way to dive into wave

## Task  

A circular wave on the water surface, emanating from a point source located at \((x_0, y_0)\), can be described by the Single Disturbance equation:  

\[
\eta(x, y, t) = \frac{A}{\sqrt{r}} \cdot \cos \left( kr - \omega t + \phi \right)
\]

where:  

- \(\eta(x, y, t)\) is the displacement of the water surface at point \((x, y)\) and time \(t\),  
- \(A\) is the amplitude of the wave,  
- \(k = \frac{2\pi}{\lambda}\) is the wave number, related to the wavelength \(\lambda\),  
- \(\omega = 2\pi f\) is the angular frequency, related to the frequency \(f\),  
- \(r = \sqrt{(x - x_0)^2 + (y - y_0)^2}\) is the distance from the source to the point \((x, y)\),  
- \(\phi\) is the initial phase.
