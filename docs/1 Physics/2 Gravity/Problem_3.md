# Problem 3: Trajectories of a Freely Released Payload Near Earth

## Motivation

When an object is released from a moving rocket near Earth, its trajectory depends on its initial conditions as well as Earthâ€™s gravitational force. The payload may follow an elliptical, parabolic, or hyperbolic path. Understanding these trajectories is crucial for:
- **Orbital insertion:** When satellites or spacecraft are inserted into orbit.
- **Reentry:** For returning payloads safely to Earth.
- **Escape scenarios:** For sending spacecraft on interplanetary or interstellar missions.

This problem blends concepts from orbital mechanics with numerical methods and is vital for modern space mission planning.

## Task

1. **Characterize Trajectories:**  
   Define and explain the physical meaning of elliptical, parabolic, and hyperbolic trajectories for a payload released near Earth.

2. **Numerical Analysis:**  
   Compute the path of the payload based on given initial conditions (position, velocity, and altitude) using numerical integration.

3. **Discussion:**  
   Discuss how these trajectories relate to orbital insertion, reentry, or escape scenarios.

4. **Simulation Tool:**  
   Develop a computational tool (using Python) to simulate and visualize the motion of the payload under Earth's gravity with various initial velocities and directions.

## Python Simulation

Below is a Python script that:
- Sets up Earth-related parameters.
- Defines three cases:
  - **Elliptical Orbit:** Initial velocity lower than the circular orbital velocity.
  - **Parabolic Trajectory:** Initial velocity exactly equal to the escape velocity.
  - **Hyperbolic Trajectory:** Initial velocity higher than the escape velocity.
- Uses `scipy.integrate.solve_ivp` to integrate the equations of motion.
- Plots the trajectories along with an outline of Earth.

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from scipy.integrate import solve_ivp

G = 6.67430e-11       # gravitational constant (m^3 kg^-1 s^-2)
M_earth = 5.972e24    # mass of Earth (kg)
mu = G * M_earth      # Earth's gravitational parameter (m^3/s^2)
R_earth = 6371e3      # Earth's radius (m)

# Initial position: 300 km above Earth's surface
altitude = 300e3                  
r0 = R_earth + altitude  # initial distance from Earth's center (m)

# Circular orbital velocity at r0 (for reference)
v_circular = np.sqrt(mu / r0)

# Escape velocity at r0
v_escape = np.sqrt(2 * mu / r0)

# Define three cases for payload release:
cases = {
    "Elliptical Orbit (v = 0.95*v_circular)": 0.95 * v_circular,
    "Parabolic Trajectory (v = v_escape)": v_escape,
    "Hyperbolic Trajectory (v = 1.1*v_escape)": 1.1 * v_escape,

    return [vx, vy, ax, ay]

# Integrate equations for each case
for label, v0 in cases.items():
    # Initial conditions: positioned at (r0, 0) with velocity vector (0, v0)
    y0 = [r0, 0, 0, v0]
    
    # Set integration time span: 
    # For elliptical orbits, a shorter integration time suffices.
    # For parabolic and hyperbolic trajectories, we extend the time span.
    if "Elliptical" in label:
        t_span = (0, 6000)  # seconds
    else:
        t_span = (0, 20000) # seconds
        
    t_eval = np.linspace(t_span[0], t_span[1], 1000)
    
    sol = solve_ivp(deriv, t_span, y0, t_eval=t_eval, rtol=1e-8)
    trajectories[label] = sol
