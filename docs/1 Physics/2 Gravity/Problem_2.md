# Problem 2

# Escape Velocities and Cosmic Velocities

## Motivation

The concept of escape velocity is crucial for understanding the conditions required to leave a celestial body's gravitational influence. Extending this concept, the first, second, and third cosmic velocities define the thresholds for orbiting, escaping, and leaving a star system. These principles underpin modern space exploration, from launching satellites to interplanetary missions.
