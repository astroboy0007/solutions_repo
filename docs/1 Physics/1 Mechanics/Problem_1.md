# Problem 1

# Investigating the Range as a Function of the Angle of Projection

## Motivation

Projectile motion, while seemingly simple, provides a rich framework for exploring fundamental principles of physics. The goal is to analyze how the range of a projectile depends on its angle of projection. Despite its simplicity, this problem offers deep insights due to its reliance on both linear and quadratic relationships. The numerous parameters involvedâ€”such as initial velocity, gravitational acceleration, and launch heightâ€”allow for a broad range of applications, from sports to aerospace engineering.

## Theoretical Foundation

To understand projectile motion, we derive the governing equations from Newton's second law.

## Equations of Motion

The motion of a projectile in a vacuum (neglecting air resistance) is governed by:


$$
x(t) = v_0 \cos(\theta) t
$$

$$
y(t) = v_0 \sin(\theta) t - \frac{1}{2} g t^2
$$


where:

- v<sub>0</sub> is the initial velocity,
- \(\theta\) is the launch angle,
- \(g\) is the acceleration due to gravity,
- \(t\) is the time.

The range \(R\) (horizontal distance) is obtained by solving for \(t\) when \(y = 0\):

\(R = \frac{v_0^2 \sin(2\theta)}{g}\)

## Family of Solutions

- Different initial velocities (( v_0 )) yield higher or lower trajectories.
- Varying launch angles (( \theta )) create different parabolic pathsâ€”steeper angles mean greater height but shorter horizontal reach.
- Gravity ( g ) affects descentâ€”on planets like Mars (( g = 3.7 ) m/sÂ²), the projectile would have a longer range than on Earth.


Graphical Representations of Range vs. Angle
The range equation (neglecting air resistance) is:
[ R = \frac{v_0^2 \sin 2\theta}{g} ]


Python Code to Plot Range vs. Angle

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Parameters
v0 = 30  # Initial velocity in m/s
g = 9.81  # Gravitational acceleration in m/sÂ²
theta = np.linspace(0, 90, 100)  # Angle from 0Â° to 90Â°

# Compute range for each angle
R = (v0**2 * np.sin(np.radians(2 * theta))) / g

# Plot
plt.figure(figsize=(8,6))
plt.plot(theta, R, label="Projectile Range vs. Angle")
plt.axvline(x=45, color='r', linestyle='--', label="Max Range at 45Â°")
plt.xlabel("Launch Angle (degrees)")
plt.ylabel("Range (meters)")
plt.title("Projectile Range vs. Launch Angle")
plt.legend()
plt.grid()
plt.show()
```

ðŸ“Œ This graph will:
- Show range peaking at 45Â° (ideal case).
- Demonstrate how increasing ( v_0 ) scales up range.
- Shift if gravity ( g ) is altered (e.g., Moon vs. Earth).


imitations & Realistic Adjustments
âœ… Key Assumptions in the Ideal Model:
- No air resistanceâ€”real projectiles experience drag, which shortens range.
- Launch and landing at same heightâ€”uneven terrains require modifications.
- Neglecting wind effectsâ€”real-world projectiles are influenced by crosswinds.
ðŸš€ More Realistic Factors:
- Air Resistance (Drag Force ( F_d ))
- Introduce ( F_d = C_d v^2 ), where ( C_d ) is the drag coefficient.
- Would shift peak angle below 45Â° due to extra deceleration.
- Wind Influence
- Headwinds shorten range; tailwinds extend it.
- Requires vector velocity adjustments.
- Variable Launch Heights
- If launching from an elevated position, the range equation must include height terms.
- Results in longer descent phases.
