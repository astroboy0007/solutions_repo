# Estimating Pi using Monte Carlo Methods

## Motivation

Monte Carlo simulations are a powerful class of computational techniques that use randomness to solve problems or estimate values. One of the most elegant applications of Monte Carlo methods is estimating the value $\pi$ of through geometric probability. By randomly generating points and analyzing their positions relative to a geometric shape, we can approximate $\pi$ in an intuitive and visually engaging way.

This problem connects fundamental concepts of probability, geometry, and numerical computation. It also provides a gateway to understanding how randomness can be harnessed to solve complex problems in physics, finance, and computer science. The Monte Carlo approach to $\pi$ estimation highlights the versatility and simplicity of this method while offering practical insights into convergence rates and computational efficiency.
